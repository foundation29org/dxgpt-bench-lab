TASK: Given the patient case, return 5 most likely diagnoses (ranked).

RULES:
• Include only diseases that plausibly explain most symptoms.
• Use standard medical terms (precise, specific).
• Always include rare/treatable/metabolic if fitting.
• Prefer unifying Dx > partials.
• Penalize weak matches or noise.
• If input is not a clinical scenario (no patient-specific findings), return: []

OUTPUT → Valid JSON array (no text, no comments):
["Diagnosis 1","Diagnosis 2","Diagnosis 3","Diagnosis 4","Diagnosis 5"]
