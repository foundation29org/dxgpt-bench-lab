{"question": "A 25-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for trouble with focus and concentration. He states that he lives at home with his parents his entire life and recently was able to get a job at a local factory. Ever since the patient started working, he has had trouble focusing on his job. He is unable to stay focused on any task. His boss often observes him \"daydreaming\" with a blank stare off into space. His boss will have to yell at him to startle him back to work. The patient states that he feels fatigued all the time and sometimes will suddenly fall asleep while operating equipment. He has tried going to bed early for the past month but is unable to fall asleep until 2 hours prior to his alarm. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 112/68 mmHg, pulse is 81/min, and respirations are 12/min. A physical exam is within normal limits.

The most appropriate initial therapy is light therapy, behavioral therapy, and sleep hygiene practices in addition to decreasing exposure to light at night.\n\nDelayed sleep phase syndrome typically presents with individuals who naturally fall asleep very late and wake up very late. This becomes problematic when they attend school or have a job that requires them to wake up early. The most appropriate initial therapy for delayed sleep phase syndrome is behavioral therapy, sleep hygiene practices, and bright light therapy. Bright light therapy involves consistent timed exposure to a light box to simulate natural outdoor light, with the hope of resetting the circadian rhythm and moving the sleep phase earlier. If these measures fail, or if a different diagnosis is suspected, a referral for polysomnography may be indicated.\n\nSletten et al. studied whether melatonin was effective in the treatment of delayed sleep phase syndrome. They found that using this medication as an adjunct to sleep hygiene was effective in improving symptoms. They recommend using multimodal therapy for this disease.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ethosuximide is the treatment of choice for absence seizures. Though this patient does have episodes of blank staring, this likely does not represent a seizure as he is arousable to return to work by his boss. Patients with absence seizures typically present in childhood and are unable to be aroused during seizure episodes.\n\nAnswer B: Polysomnography or a sleep study would be indicated after sleep hygiene practices have failed. Polysomnography could be the most appropriate initial step in management if there was a suspected diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea or an unknown cause of this patient's fatigue. Patients with sleep apnea typically snore and this disease is associated with obesity and increasing age.\n\nAnswer D: Modafinil is a treatment for narcolepsy. Though this patient does have sudden episodes of falling asleep while at work, this is more likely to be related to his sleep schedule. Patients with narcolepsy generally do not feel tired immediately before their episodes of sleep.\n\nAnswer E: Zolpidem is a muscle relaxant and hypnotic with the mechanism of action of a benzodiazepine. Though a drug like zolpidem could be used to help this patient fall asleep, the most appropriate first step is to address the patient's sleep hygiene prior to prescribing a potentially addictive drug.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe most appropriate initial step in the management of patients with delayed sleep phase syndrome is behavioral therapy, bright light therapy, and sleep hygiene.", "link": "https://step2.medbullets.com/testview?qid=109002"}

This neurodegenerative process leads to movement abnormalities such as bradykinesia, \u201ccogwheel\u201d muscle rigidity (intermittently increased muscle tone with passive range of motion), shuffling gait, postural instability, and a resting tremor sometimes referred to as \u201cpill-rolling\u201d in quality. Parkinson disease usually presents with unilateral symptoms and subsequently progresses to bilateral involvement. First-line treatment involves dopaminergic drugs such as carbidopa-levodopa. Antimuscarinic agents can also be used for symptom control.\n\nZhong et al. review the role of the cerebellum in tremor in Parkinson disease. The authors find that the cerebellum may modulate tremor amplitude via cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuits. The authors recommend further study of the cerebellum as an alternative therapeutic target in Parkinson patients with dopamine-resistant tremors.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cerebellar stroke can manifest as an intention tremor, which presents as an oscillatory tremor that increases in amplitude at the endpoint of visually goal-directed movement. Intention tremors are best exhibited in the finger-nose-finger test in which the patient repeatedly touches their nose and then extends their arm to touch the examiner's finger. Patients would also have more severe symptoms including ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and nystagmus.\n\nAnswer B: Essential tremor is a condition that is often familial and presents as a high frequency (4-9 Hz) tremor that occurs with sustained posture and is worsened with movement. Treatment includes propranolol and primidone.\n\nAnswer C: Huntington disease is an autosomal dominant trinucleotide repeat disorder that leads to neurodegeneration of the caudate and putamen. Chorea is a hallmark movement abnormality associated with Huntington disease and presents with spontaneous, jerking, purposeless involuntary movements.\n\nAnswer D: Lacunar stroke can result in ischemia to the subthalamic nucleus and produce hemiballismus.

The outpouching can often collect and store urine, resulting in slow postvoid dribbling and recurrent urinary tract infections. Urethral diverticula can often be associated with expressed purulent or bloody discharge on exam. Initial workup includes urinalysis and transvaginal ultrasound. Diagnosis can be confirmed with a pelvic MRI before referral for surgical excision.\n\nGreiman et al. review urethral diverticula and its treatment. They note that surgical repair is challenging. However, it is still recommended to perform surgery in appropriate candidates.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Overflow incontinence (caused by impaired detrusor activity or bladder outlet obstruction) can also present with involuntary loss of urine due to urinary retention. However, this patient\u2019s normal postvoid residual volume (< 150 mL) makes this an unlikely diagnosis. Patients will often present with a constant dribbling of urine and a sensation of incomplete voiding.\n\nAnswer B: Pelvic organ prolapse occurs due to weakened pelvic support and increased intraabdominal pressure and can be exacerbated by increasing parity. While it can also present with incontinence, physical exam often reveals a bulging mass that increases with Valsava maneuver - a finding that is absent in this patient.\n\nAnswer C: Stress urinary incontinence is caused by urethral hypermobility leading to urinary leakage from increased intraabdominal pressure. This patient\u2019s urinary loss is unrelated to coughing or laughing, and stress incontinence would not explain the anterior vaginal mass. On exam, urine may be released with coughing.\n\nAnswer E: Vesicovaginal fistula is an abnormal tract between the vagina and bladder that presents with constant leakage of urine due to the direct draining of urine from the bladder to the vagina.

Occlusions to branches of the basilar artery lead to infarctions of various parts of the midbrain. Midbrain lesions almost always manifest with an ipsilateral oculomotor palsy (ptosis from the levator palpebrae muscle; mydriasis from loss of parasympathetic inflow; abduction and excyclotorsion of the globe from the superior rectus, medial rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior obliques). There may also be contralateral ataxia (cerebellar peduncle after decussation and red nucleus), contralateral hemiparesis (corticospinal tract before decussation at the medulla), and parkinsonian tremor (substantia nigra).\n\nSciacca et al. review the anatomy and clinical signs of strokes of the midbrain, pons, and medulla. They discuss how a stroke of the midbrain will present with oculomotor palsy and paresis. They recommend being vigilant for symptoms of strokes to allow for early diagnosis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Lateral medullary syndrome (Wallenberg syndrome) is usually due to a stroke of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery.

In this patient with intact sensorium and without dysarthria, lateral medullary syndrome is less likely.\n\nAnswer B: Lateral pontine syndrome can be caused by interruption of blood supply by the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. It presents with ipsilateral limb and gait ataxia, ipsilateral Horner syndrome, ipsilateral facial hemianesthesia, ipsilateral facial paralysis, nystagmus and vertigo, and contralateral loss of pain and temperature in the body. In this patient with intact sensorium and without facial paralysis, vertigo, and oculomotor palsy, midbrain stroke is more likely than a pontine stroke.\n\nAnswer C: Medial pontine syndrome can be due to occlusion of the paramedian branches of the basilar artery and disrupts the abducens nerve, the dorsal column-medial lemniscus, and the corticospinal tract. This results in contralateral spastic hemiparesis, ipsilateral lateral rectus paralysis (eye turned down and in), and contralateral loss of vibration and stereognosis. In this patient with ptosis, and an eye turned down and out, oculomotor palsy and a midbrain stroke are more likely than a pontine stroke.\n\nAnswer E: Strokes of the posterior limb of the internal capsule lead to contralateral hemiparesis. Strokes of the internal capsule would not be expected to lead to oculomotor nerve palsy or dysdiadochokinesia. The constellation of ataxia, hemiparesis, and cranial nerve palsy is more suggestive of a brainstem pathology than of a lacunar stroke in the internal capsule.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMidbrain strokes commonly present with ipsilateral oculomotor nerve palsy and contralateral hemiparesis/hemiplegia, contralateral hemiataxia, and/or contralateral tremor.", "link": "https://bit.ly/3FwRzGJ"}

Physical exam reveals increased work of breathing, pulmonary crackles, and wheezing. A chest radiograph is performed as seen in Figure A. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient's current symptoms?", "choicesA": "Atypical pneumonia", "choicesB": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "choicesC": "Community acquired pneumonia", "choicesD": "Medication administration", "choicesE": "Poor cardiac function", "answer_idx": "D", "answer": "Medication administration", "explanation": "This patient is presenting after administration of naloxone with respiratory distress, wheezing, crackles, and pulmonary edema on chest radiography, suggesting acute pulmonary edema. Given the presence of symptoms immediately following naloxone administration, the cause of the pulmonary edema is likely the naloxone (medication-induced) that was administered.\n\nOpioid use disorder is a common problem in the United States and can lead to overdose, which is life-threatening if not treated. Patients with symptoms of opioid intoxication including miosis, bradypnea, and altered mental status should be empirically given naloxone, as it may be life-saving and is relatively benign. Naloxone should only be given for patients with unstable vitals or who are failing to ventilate/oxygenate or protect their airway. Naloxone commonly precipitates withdrawal and may cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and pain. It is possible for naloxone to cause pulmonary edema (via a poorly elucidated mechanism). Pulmonary edema presents with wheezing, tachypnea, and pulmonary crackles. The most important intervention when treating pulmonary edema is to address the underlying cause and start the patient on positive pressure ventilation. Diuretics may be administered if the patient is volume overloaded. An echogardiogram can rule out poor cardiac function as the underlying etiology as well.\n\nLassen et al. review naloxone use and pulmonary edema. They note that naloxone administration can cause non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and that the mechanism is not well elucidated. They recommend that naloxone should only be used at the lowest dose possible to stabilize the patient.\n\nFigure A is a chest radiograph demonstrating \"fluffy\" interstitial infiltrates throughout both lung fields suggestive of pulmonary edema.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Atypical pneumonia may present with a dry cough, fever, hypoxia, and increased interstitial markings on chest radiograph. These patients are usually well appearing, and the opacities are not as \"fluffy\" as pulmonary edema. A common cause is Mycoplasma pneumoniae.\n\nAnswer B: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presents with a flattened diaphragm and increased number of visible ribs on chest radiography as a result of air accumulation in the chest. Pneumonia may be present on chest radiograph and is a common cause of COPD flares. A COPD flare may present with wheezing, poor air movement, hypoxia, and hypercarbia.\n\nAnswer C: Community-acquired pneumonia presents with a fever, cough, hypoxia, and a lobar consolidation on chest radiograph. This infiltrate is usually confined to one lobe and is thus often called \"lobar pneumonia.\" Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause.\n\nAnswer E: Poor cardiac function can cause pulmonary edema via increased hydrostatic pressure backing up into the lungs causing fluid leakage. Though the appearance of pulmonary edema would be the same, naloxone causes non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. In this patient with a previous myocardial infarction, a low ejection fraction may plausibly be contributing to this patient's pulmonary edema; however, the association of symptoms with naloxone administration makes this a less likely etiology for this case.\n\nBullet Summary:\nNaloxone can cause non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.", "link": "https://step2.medbullets.com/testview?qid=216360"}
